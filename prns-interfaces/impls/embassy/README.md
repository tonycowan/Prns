# Personal RNS (Prns)

This crate is one package in the Personal RNS public Rust graph. Quick overviews, the complete feature guide, API documentation, examples, and the cross-language SDK overview are available at [prns.dev](https://prns.dev) or [reticulum.rs](https://reticulum.rs), and in the [source repository](https://github.com/KenAKAFrosty/Prns).

All public packages use the same engine, release version, and dual MIT/Apache-2.0 license.

## USB bootloader entry

With the `usb` feature, `WebUsbBootloaderEntry::Supported` receives a validated
`WebUsbBootloaderMode`: `PrnsFlasher` for the existing `0x50` update request,
or `Uf2HandOff` for the `0x55` recovery-drive request. Callbacks schedule a
reset after acknowledging the control transfer; board firmware owns the
bootloader mode and reset implementation. Both requests require the exact
PRNS signature and an empty data stage. See the
[T1000-E recovery contract](../../../personal-hopspot/embedded/nrf52840/RECOVERY.md).

## Host-side BLE checks

The `bluetooth-auto-embassy` validation suite runs the production Embassy BLE
component tests on a normal host, including the Trouble backend, frame pools,
connection slots, and supervisor. It is registered for PR, release, and scheduled
validation tiers. PR CI and relevant pre-push checks execute it without a
connected board. To run it from the repository root:

```console
python3 validation/run.py run --suite bluetooth-auto-embassy
```

Member reads use the core's checked `receive_frame` boundary before dispatch.
A faulty source reporting a length larger than the supplied buffer follows the
existing transport-closure path instead of reaching an unchecked slice. Tests
cover exact-capacity and empty frames, invalid lengths, source failure, and
inactive slots without growing the embedded buffers.

## Duplex fanout

Every active fanout member uses the core receive driver while selected sends
remain pending, including unselected peers and peers whose sends finished early.
Each selected send is started exactly once. A local async mutex serializes
delivery into the fleet's single inbound lane. Pending forwarding retains the
received frame in that member's existing receive buffer and continues polling
its send.
There are no extra packet buffers or spawned tasks; the mutex and per-peer future
state still have a resource cost that firmware builds must measure.

The shared driver borrows caller-pinned work and the forwarder rather than
embedding their owned state. Its receive selection also borrows pinned futures
and uses the shared length validator directly. The [Nordic layout measurement](measurements/ble-duplex-layout.md)
records the resulting static-memory savings without changing peer capacity,
packet buffers, or the runtime stack reservation.

Receive, length, send, and forwarding failures retire the affected member without
restarting another member's send. The existing two-second fanout deadline and
disable cancellation remain in force, including while forwarding is blocked.
TX is recorded when the sink settles, so cancellation cannot erase an already
completed send. RX is recorded after shared-lane delivery settles. Send and
receive state are separate: cancelled forwarding retires its peer even when
that peer was unselected or its send already completed.

Once all selected sends settle, no new receive starts; already-received frames
finish forwarding before fanout returns. The join performs one extra poll pass
on that transition so earlier members observe later send completions without an
external wake. It does not spin while forwarding is blocked. Receive pumps remain
scoped to fanout, not independent tasks.

Tests use real Embassy fleet lanes to cover concurrent peer progress, shared-lane
pressure, failure isolation, and exact accounting. This is host component evidence,
not an emulated controller or full embedded node. Native RF behavior and firmware
resource evidence remain separate.

## Node and supervisor simulation

The simulation package's [`embassy_ble` target](../../../validation/simulation/tests/embassy_ble/main.rs)
runs this supervisor with virtual BLE radios, real fleet lifecycle channels, and
coordinated manual time. It checks the exact handshake timeout boundary,
successful peer admission, and disable teardown on both ends. These scenarios
run in PR CI and relevant pre-push checks through `virtual-device-simulation`.
The same target runs three complete Embassy nodes through simultaneous fragmented
fanout and targeted traffic, checking whole deliveries, command settlement, byte
accounting, and hub disable/reconnection. The [simulation coverage and limits](../../../validation/simulation/README.md)
describe the private clock, entropy, and storage fixtures. These are host runtime
tests; native controllers and board firmware have separate assurance paths.

```console
python3 validation/run.py run --suite bluetooth-auto-embassy --suite virtual-device-simulation
```

## Radio transaction firmware size

Radio transactions borrow the caller's immutable previous configuration while
staging and publishing changes. They still own the staged configuration and
compare it with the previous snapshot before restoring traffic. Command checks
that only distinguish `Quiesce` or `Resume` match their variants directly.

The [T-Echo measurement](measurements/radio-transaction-flash.md) compares this
internal change with the exact prior implementation under the configured
firmware recipe. Radio initialization, publication acknowledgement, failure
recovery, and Base Duo 2.4 GHz support retain their existing contracts.
