# Guided flasher browser qualification

This suite runs the Dioxus flasher against a deterministic, signed four-board
candidate and an injected fake device bridge. The candidate uses a public
test-only Minisign key. Its private key is not stored in this repository.

`browser-test-fixture` selects the compile-time test trust root and the pinned
0.2.6 release's historical board contract. Channel and manifest signatures,
manifest semantics, artifact sizes, and SHA-256 values are still verified. It
is not a default feature and is rejected from production build commands and
output by the production-boundary gate.

Install the pinned Chromium revision once, then run the suites:

```text
npm run install:browser
npm run test:browser
npm run test:production-boundary
```

The browser suite requires no physical hardware. It records UI behavior around
the fake bridge; the lower-level bridge suite remains responsible for serial
protocol, MD5, and disconnect behavior.

The `readiness` project first checks that the signed fixture hydrates and its
flasher controls respond. If this shared prerequisite fails, the run fails once
without retrying every dependent Chromium scenario. Its trace, screenshot, and
runtime-error attachment identify the common failure. A healthy fixture still
runs every existing scenario with the usual retry policy.
