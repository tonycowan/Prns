# personal-rns

`personal-rns` provides one JavaScript/TypeScript API for native Node.js, Bun, and browsers.

The root export selects the native backend in Node.js and Bun and the cooperative WebAssembly backend in browser bundlers. Explicit `personal-rns/native` and `personal-rns/browser` subpaths are available when runtime selection must be fixed. The provider-neutral `personal-rns/contract` subpath exposes the generated contract and validation helpers without loading a native addon, WebAssembly module, Worker, or host runtime.

## Install

For a published registry release:

```console
npm install personal-rns
```

Prns 0.3.7 is available as a public GitHub prerelease. Registry publication has an independent qualification gate, so use the [source-checkout instructions](../docs/sdks.md#typescript-and-javascript) when you need the exact candidate before that gate completes.

## Use the contract without selecting a provider

Applications and integration packages that only need the shared data contract can import it without selecting or starting a backend:

```ts
import {
  HOST_CONTRACT_ABI,
  destinationHash,
  type DestinationHash,
  type HostCommand,
} from "personal-rns/contract";

const destination: DestinationHash = destinationHash(new Uint8Array(16));
```

This subpath contains the generated types, semantic byte brands, exact-integer policy, contract constants and guards, and validation constructors. Host creation remains owned by the root, native, and browser entrypoints.

## Create a host

Node.js and Bun use the native backend selected by the root export:

```ts
import { Prns, Tag } from "personal-rns";

const created = await Prns.create({
  identity: Tag("GenerateEphemeral"),
  role: "Endpoint",
});
if (created.tag !== "Ready") {
  throw new Error(`node creation failed: ${created.tag}`);
}

const node = created.data;
console.log(node.identityHash);
await node.stop();
```

Browsers use the cooperative WebAssembly backend on a module DedicatedWorker by default:

```ts
import { Prns } from "personal-rns/browser";

const created = await Prns.create({});
if (created.tag !== "Ready") {
  throw new Error(`browser node creation failed: ${created.tag}`);
}

const node = created.data;
console.log(node.execution);
console.log(node.backendInfo);
await node.stop();
```

The Worker owns the Rust engine, command settlement, WebSocket and Auto Wi-Fi
connections, and stateful Bluetooth/USB framing. Application-event batches
cross to the page as one packed transferable buffer and are materialized there.
Web Bluetooth and WebUSB device objects remain on the page because those APIs
are permission-gated page capabilities; their packet traffic uses a separate
bounded capability channel.

Protocol cryptography remains in the engine's WebAssembly instance by default.
Applications with sustained concurrent protocol and resource work can select
the measured role-separated execution policy:

```ts
import { Prns, Tag } from "personal-rns/browser";

const created = await Prns.create({
  crypto: Tag("ParallelWorkers"),
});
```

`ParallelWorkers` owns two Web Crypto workers for resource operations and four
portable-WebAssembly workers for protocol verification. Same-turn protocol
jobs coalesce at a microtask boundary into bounded batches. Worker failure,
saturation, or unsupported browser cryptography returns the retained operation
to the authoritative Rust engine rather than changing protocol behavior. This
mode trades additional startup time and memory for role isolation and parallel
capacity; `PortableWasm` remains the stewardship-oriented default.

`execution: "MainThread"` is the explicit diagnostic and embedding mode. It is
also the only mode that accepts an already imported `wasm` module, a custom
entropy function, or a custom clock. Worker startup and protocol failures are
typed `WorkerStartFailed` and `WorkerProtocolFailed` creation outcomes; Prns
does not silently fall back to the main thread. A static deployment that keeps
the generated WASM package outside the npm package can provide its module URL:

```ts
const created = await Prns.create({
  wasmModuleUrl: new URL("./pkg/prns_wasm.js", import.meta.url),
});
```

Web Bluetooth connects the browser as a GATT central to a native or embedded
Prns node advertising the shared Bluetooth Auto service. Start the chooser
from a user action in a supported secure-context browser:

```ts
connectButton.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const connected = await node.interfaces.bluetooth.connect();
  if (connected.tag !== "Connected") {
    reportBluetoothFailure(connected);
    return;
  }

  const session = connected.data;
  showInterface(session.interfaceId);
});
```

The session carries Reticulum packets in both directions over the shared GATT
control and data characteristics. Browser instances do not advertise this
service, so a browser-to-browser Bluetooth link still requires a native or
embedded Prns transport node nearby.

## Handle events and commands

Application events and diagnostics are separate, bounded, single-owner streams. Claiming a stream is an explicit outcome, so an ownership conflict never appears as an iterator exception. Handle that boundary once, then keep the event loop flat:

```ts
import { match } from "personal-rns";

const claim = node.claimEvents();
if (claim.tag === "AlreadyClaimed") {
  reportConsumerConflict(claim.data.lane);
  return;
}

for await (const event of claim.data) {
  match(event, {
    SingleDelivery: ({ destination, plaintext, sourceInterface }) => {
      receiveSingle(destination, plaintext, sourceInterface);
    },
    LinkDelivery: ({ linkId, plaintext, sourceInterface }) => {
      receiveLinkPacket(linkId, plaintext, sourceInterface);
    },
    Request: receiveRequest,
    Response: receiveResponse,
    ResponseSegment: receiveResponseSegment,
    ResourceAvailable: receiveResource,
    ResourceSegment: receiveResourceSegment,
    ResourceNeedsDecompression: provideDecompressedResource,
    ChannelMessage: receiveChannelMessage,
  });
}
```

Host-to-node control uses the same generated `HostCommand` and `CommandSettlement` sums in Node.js, Bun, and browsers:

```ts
import { Tag, match } from "personal-rns";

const settlement = await node.execute(
  Tag("SendSinglePacket", { destination, payload }),
);
if (settlement.tag === "Failed") {
  reportCommandFailure(settlement.data);
  return;
}

match(settlement.data, {
  Announced: confirmAnnounce,
  PacketDelivered: confirmDelivery,
  LinkCloseQueued: confirmLinkClose,
  InterfaceAttached: rememberInterface,
  InterfaceDetached: forgetInterface,
  LinkEstablished: rememberLink,
  PathDiscovered: rememberPath,
  Identified: confirmIdentity,
  ResponseReceived: receiveResponse,
  ResponseSent: confirmResponse,
  ResourceSent: confirmResource,
  ResourceStrategySet: confirmResourceStrategy,
  RequesterAllowed: confirmRequester,
});
```
The compiler requires every declared case. Commands settle their returned promises, expected failures are typed tagged outcomes, and public binary values are semantically branded `Uint8Array` instances. Browser backends attach `WebSocketClient` and `BrowserRendezvous` through the bounded cooperative transport and return `UnsupportedByBackend` for native-only interface kinds. Each host reports its current support through `backendInfo` and `capabilities`. Browser destination registration, node-page registration, `snapshot()`, and `hostSnapshot()` are asynchronous so the public API is identical across Worker and main-thread execution. The browser `hostSnapshot()` projects the generated inspection contract with revisioned routes, destination identities, logical interfaces, transfer counters, runtime health, and exact persistence status. A `ResourceAvailable` event owns a `ResourceStream`; its `claim()` method uses the same `Claimed | AlreadyClaimed` contract.

## Observe browser state

Browser projections provide stable, revisioned snapshots for lifecycle, interfaces, routes, active links, and bounded diagnostics. Calling `latest()` is synchronous and does not capture new engine state. A subscription activates demand-driven capture until its release function runs; `synchronize()` explicitly requests a current snapshot and settles as `Synchronized`, `Busy`, or `Unavailable`.

```ts
import { prnsView } from "personal-rns/browser";

const links = node.projection(prnsView("Links"));
const release = links.subscribe(() => {
  renderLinks(links.latest().value);
});

const synchronized = await links.synchronize();
if (synchronized.tag === "Synchronized") {
  renderLinks(synchronized.data.value);
}

release();
```

Framework adapters expose the same projections through `personal-rns/react`, `personal-rns/solid`, `personal-rns/vue`, `personal-rns/svelte`, and `personal-rns/qwik`. `personal-rns/web-component` provides the non-framework `prns-bridge` custom element. Each adapter owns subscription cleanup at its framework lifecycle boundary and requires an explicit client-rendered Prns provider or context.

Browser hosts are ephemeral by default. `persistentBrowser()` selects a caller-named `localStorage` root for the host identity, Bluetooth identity, routing state, destination identities, tunnels, and ratchets. Interfaces remain caller-supplied after restart. `stop()` flushes the bounded state before settling, while restoration and flush results appear on the diagnostic stream and in `hostSnapshot()`:

```ts
import { Prns, persistentBrowser } from "personal-rns/browser";

const created = await Prns.create(persistentBrowser("my-app"));
if (created.tag !== "Ready") {
  reportCreationFailure(created);
  return;
}

const node = created.data;
await attachApplicationInterfaces(node);
await runApplication(node);

const stopped = await node.stop();
if (stopped.tag !== "Stopped") {
  reportShutdownFailure(stopped);
}
```

Sending a Resource in the browser accepts either bytes or a `Blob`. The `Blob` path slices the source into bounded segments instead of materializing the whole value:

```ts
import { Tag, match } from "personal-rns/browser";

const sent = await node.sendResourceBlob(link, file, {
  compression: Tag("Auto"),
  packedMetadata,
});
if (sent.tag === "Failed") {
  reportResourceFailure(sent.data);
  return;
}

match(sent.data, {
  ResourceSent: confirmResource,
});
```

`Auto` compression runs the shared Rust codec in a dedicated module Worker. The send remains correct if Worker startup or compression is unavailable: it continues with the uncompressed segment. Planning, metadata placement, segment bounds, and wire submission remain in the shared Rust implementation.

## More examples

[`examples/native-lifecycle.ts`](examples/native-lifecycle.ts) is a complete native lifecycle program with a self-contained loopback interface. The [browser transport playground](../prns-wasm/examples/browser-playground/README.md) runs a live node with permission-gated Web Bluetooth, WebUSB, and Wi-Fi controls.

## Development dependencies

The npm manifest overrides Solid's Seroval dependency with 1.6.8 to address
[GHSA-p6vx-979v-rg4c](https://github.com/lxsmnsyc/seroval/security/advisories/GHSA-p6vx-979v-rg4c).
Remove the override once Solid's dependency range requires a patched version.
This development override does not control the framework versions installed by
applications consuming this package.
