# Personal RNS host contract

`prns-host` is the language-neutral center of every hosted Personal RNS SDK. The canonical schema in `schema/host-contract-v1.json` owns stable discriminants, fixed byte widths, semantic configuration, commands, outcomes, application events, diagnostics, and resource streams. Deterministic generation projects that vocabulary into Rust, TypeScript, C, C#, Python, Go, Swift, Kotlin, and Julia.

The schema flowers into three runtime paths:

```text
host-contract-v1.json
    -> generated Rust vocabulary -> native Rust host -> direct N-API adapter -> Node/Bun SDK
                              |            |
                              |            -> C capsule -> Python/.NET/Go/Swift/Kotlin/Julia/C/C++
                              |
                              -> cooperative Rust host -> WebAssembly adapter -> browser SDK
```

Node does not detour through C: its N-API adapter talks directly to the same native Rust host used by the capsule. The browser remains cooperative because the browser owns time, entropy, and I/O, but it consumes the same generated semantic contract. No adapter reimplements routing, Reticulum semantics, queue policy, or event meaning.

The C capsule is the native-language boundary. Rust enums, allocators, futures, and unwinding never cross it; owned opaque handles, size-prefixed structures, fixed-width discriminants, borrowed views, and explicit status values do. C gets one generated function for every command case and operation instead of a generic submit envelope.

## Ownership layers

| Layer | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `core` | Stable vocabulary, limits, lifecycle, admission policy, and backend-independent event semantics |
| `impls/native` | The real threaded/Tokio host, semantic configuration, bounded command submission, and interruptible waits |
| `impls/cooperative` | Explicit time and entropy for browsers, embedded executors, and caller-driven hosts |
| `impls/tokio` | Blocking and asynchronous native-host scheduling |
| `abi/c` | Stable opaque handles, pull-based events/resources, panic containment, and ABI/version gates |
| `bindings/*` | Idiomatic types, cancellation, deterministic ownership, package metadata, and no new protocol semantics |

## Ecosystem shape

Rust and TypeScript/JavaScript are the paved application SDKs. Python, .NET, Go, Swift, Kotlin/Java, Julia, C, and C++ are source-ready SDK previews: their contract and live in-tree journeys are implemented, while idiomatic public packaging and native artifact delivery remain active release work. The [SDK guide](../docs/sdks.md) is the user-facing source of truth for that distinction.

| Ecosystem | Typed cases | Async/event surface | Intended public distribution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript, Node, Bun, browser | `casework` unions and exhaustive `match()` | `AsyncIterableIterator<T>` | one `personal-rns` npm package with native and browser exports |
| .NET | sealed records and exhaustive `Match` helpers | `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` | `PersonalRns` NuGet with runtime-specific native assets |
| Python | frozen variant classes | async iterators | platform wheels containing the native capsule |
| Go | generated closed interfaces and concrete cases | context-aware pull streams | Go module plus native release archive |
| Swift | generated enums | `AsyncSequence` | Swift Package plus native release archive/pkg-config |
| Kotlin, Java, Android | generated sealed interfaces | one-shot Kotlin `Flow` | Maven JAR; Android uses the same API with JNA AAR and per-ABI native assets |
| Julia | generated abstract types and concrete structs | Julia iteration/tasks | Julia package plus native release archive |
| C and C++ | fixed enums, structs, and opaque handles | interruptible blocking pull | content-addressed native artifact with header, static/dynamic libraries, and pkg-config |

Commands settle as an explicit success or failure case. Cancellation does not abandon a blocked foreign thread: each adapter interrupts the native wait and joins its ownership boundary before release. Application and diagnostic lanes are claimed once. Application data remains lossless inside declared bounds; diagnostics may drop newest and report an exact accumulated gap. Resource bodies have one consumer and retain their own native handle after the parent event is released.

## Request response limits

Request response limits apply before adapter binary decoding. For packet and
whole, metadata-free Resource responses, `maximumResponseBytes` / `maximum_response_bytes` counts the complete
encoded response value, excluding only its outer request-ID envelope. For
example, nine bytes returned as MessagePack bin8 require a limit of eleven; raw
nine-byte responses require nine. A nil response counts as one byte. Zero is a
real bound, not unlimited; omit the optional limit for unlimited.

Legacy raw Resource bodies count in full, and compressed bodies count after
inflation. Whole metadata-bearing responses count literal file bytes, excluding
metadata and its framing; file content is never parsed as a response envelope.
Independent transfer/storage ceilings still apply. Segmented Resource responses
retain a stricter admission bound on the complete advertised uncompressed stream,
including envelope and metadata. The shared-core
[response-size accounting follow-up](../prns-core/plans/response-size-accounting.md)
owns removing that transport discrepancy. Native adapters still return decoded
binary data where they already did; the limit is not a decoded-data budget.

## Contract workflow

Change the schema first. Generated files are never edited directly.

```sh
./tools/prns run repo.host-contract.generate
./tools/prns run repo.host-contract.check
python3 tools/release/check-host-sdk-versions.py
python3 validation/run.py verify
```

The schema owns scalar ranges, fixed-width values, handles and release ownership, records, closed unions, discriminants, commands, callable operations, borrowed-result lifetimes, interrupt/readiness relationships, and the three creation gates. A typed parser rejects unknown grammar, duplicate projected names, recursive value types, flattened C collisions, invalid releases, broken lifetimes, and stale projections before rendering any language.

Generated raw protocols and operation inventories give hand-written adapters a structural target. Those adapters own only language idiom, memory marshalling, cancellation, and scheduling. JavaScript maps exact `u64` values to `bigint` and uses safe-integer `number` only for the schema's bounded `safeInt` and `safeUint` scalars.

Registered Linux native smokes exercise real creation, ABI/schema/product mismatch gates, stream single-ownership, wait interruption, and command settlement across C, C++, .NET, Python, Go, Swift, Kotlin/JVM, and Julia. The shared persistent journey additionally covers a real loopback interface, announce discovery, link establishment, request and response, bounded resource transfer, restart, and persistence restoration.

Product `0.3.1`, schema 1, and C ABI 1 are the first real baseline. There is no schema-2 compatibility layer or legacy host-options layout. Browser persisted state has its own version, currently 1, and its JavaScript/WASM boundary checks that value independently of the host schema.

## Release assets

`tools/release/package-host-native.py` creates a relocatable target artifact containing the generated header, dynamic and static libraries, pkg-config metadata, both project licenses, an exact commit, and SHA-256/size records for every shipped file. The host SDK workflow is prepared to build GNU and musl Linux, macOS, Windows, and Android targets. Staged Python wheels and the NuGet package consume those same outputs; the Maven staging repository and source-first Go, Swift, and Julia packages remain anchored to the identical contract version.

Publication is an explicit, SHA-gated workflow-dispatch action. Building and testing never implicitly publish.

## Adding another language

Read [`bindings/README.md`](bindings/README.md). A new adapter starts from the generated contract and C ABI, preserves the ownership/cancellation rules, maps closed cases to the language's strongest sum-type form, and proves the same live smoke before convenience APIs are added.
