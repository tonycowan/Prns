//! The receiver's half of RNS 1.4.2's resource transfer, one file per phase of an incoming transfer's life: the [`gate`] admits or refuses the advertisement, [`rounds`] pumps part requests until the register fills, [`offload`] lends the streamed open's chews to a pool worker, [`conclude`] verifies, proves, and delivers (or fails by name), [`cancel`] handles the sender's mid-flight abort, and the [`watchdog`] enforces every deadline.
