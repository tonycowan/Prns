# Personal RNS (Prns)

This crate is one package in the Personal RNS public Rust graph. Quick overviews, the complete feature guide, API documentation, examples, and the cross-language SDK overview are available at [prns.dev](https://prns.dev) or [reticulum.rs](https://reticulum.rs), and in the [source repository](https://github.com/KenAKAFrosty/Prns).

All public packages use the same engine, release version, and dual MIT/Apache-2.0 license.

## BLE receive boundary

`interfaces::bluetooth_auto::receive_frame` validates a backend's reported length
before exposing a borrowed whole frame. Its typed error distinguishes source
failures from invalid lengths. Tokio peers, the shared duplex sender, and Embassy
member reception use this same boundary. It adds no buffer or allocation and
preserves the underlying source's cancellation semantics; empty frames stay empty.

## BLE duplex transfers

`interfaces::bluetooth_auto::send_frame_duplex` owns executor-neutral progress for
one send alongside whole-frame reception and asynchronous forwarding. Callers
supply both buffers, transport halves, and a `BleFrameForwarder`. The helper
uses no allocation or runtime dependency. Pending receives must be cancellation
safe; cancelling the operation or encountering a receive failure requires retiring
the transport because its send may be partial. Adapters own custody, accounting,
timeouts, and teardown. Forwarders return a typed result; forwarding failure retires
the transport even if its send has already settled. Tokio uses an infallible seam,
while Embassy preserves shared-lane delivery errors and accounts TX immediately
after the sink settles.

`receive_frames_during` owns the underlying receive/forward loop for a fallible
work future. Embassy keeps that work alive until the other fanout sends settle,
so unselected and already-finished peers can also receive. Completion wins over a
new receive but still awaits forwarding of an already-received frame. Adapters
track unsettled forwarding separately from send completion for safe cancellation.

## Portable host capabilities

`prns-core::capabilities` defines optional, platform-neutral observations that applications and
future PRNS policy can share without depending on a particular board or operating system. The
initial capability set includes validated fixed-point geographic positions, an allocation-free
GNSS/NMEA provider, and coherent battery/external-power observations. Embedded, mobile, and desktop hosts remain
responsible for acquiring the observations, and core never publishes them or changes network
behavior merely because they are available.

## Request transport planning

`EngineState::plan_request_transport` rejects missing or inactive links before
choosing `RequestTransport::Packet` or `Resource`. The packet choice respects
both the negotiated link MDU and the bounded request payload capacity. Hosts
must preserve the typed rejection rather than treating every non-packet result
as a large request. The legacy `request_fits_packet` predicate delegates to this
plan but cannot distinguish a rejection from a Resource-sized request.

Resource-backed requests settle through `SendRequest`, including typed
`RequestTransferFailed(SendResourceFailure)` upload failures. After advertisement,
the matching link/command/request receipt owns the terminal result: upload proof
alone is not response success, and late failures cannot settle a retired receipt.
An accepted Resource response retires its obsolete upload even if proof was lost.
Request envelopes must use a whole Resource; segmented responses remain supported.

Response-size accounting is not yet uniform between packets and Resources.
The [accounting follow-up](plans/response-size-accounting.md) records the current
boundary behavior and the cases a shared-core correction must preserve.

## Request ingress diagnostics

`EngineState::ingest_packet_into_report` and `ingest_classified_into_report` return an optional
`RequestIngressDiagnostic` for locally handled link request packets. It distinguishes early
admission failures, application delivery, and RemoteControl pairing outcomes without retaining
payloads, peer identities, invitation proofs, confirmation codes, or grants. Rejected requests
remain silent on the wire; the report does not add journal events or change request policy.
Unclassifiable packets and packets forwarded without local handling have no request report.

The Embassy runtime emits these reports at DEBUG on the `prns::request` log target when its
existing `log` feature is enabled. Other hosts may consume the same core report directly.
