# Flasher tester rosters

From 0.3.8 until 1.0, the generator creates a schema-5 release-owner record:
`schema`, `release.version`, `release_owner`, and `confirmed_on`. It requires no
physical-board, browser, or installer assignments. Fill in the real release owner
and date, validate it with the command below, and commit it before candidate
creation. The signed candidate continues to bind those exact bytes. Automated
acceptance follows [the release gate](../README.md#pre-10-automated-release-gate).

## Historical physical rosters (through 0.3.7)

Before building the candidate that will be signed, create `VERSION.json` here from the
catalog-aware template:

```sh
./tools/prns release tester-roster create -- \
  --version VERSION \
  --output release/acceptance/rosters/VERSION.json
```

The command selects exactly the catalog's current shipping boards. The resulting roster must
contain one physical assignment for every shipping board on both surfaces, three Firefox Web
Serial assignments, one Safari fallback assignment, and five published-archive installer
assignments. Replace every template identity and date before validation. The physical assignments
collectively cover Linux, macOS, and Windows on both surfaces. Use public nonsecret identities such
as `github:handle`, not email addresses.

The same person may hold multiple or all assignments. The roster models required coverage, not a
minimum team size. Every physical assignment confirms access to its named board, working cables,
serial/mount permissions, the correct stable Chromium browser when applicable, and reviewed
recovery instructions. Each Firefox Web Serial assignment binds one eligible shipping ESP-serial
board to its required desktop OS and exact stable browser. Safari fallback and installer
assignments separately confirm access to their exact browser or target archive. Do not claim
readiness that has not been confirmed.

Validate the roster against the exact candidate source identity:

```sh
./tools/prns release tester-roster validate -- \
  --roster release/acceptance/rosters/VERSION.json \
  --version VERSION
```

The release build requires this exact committed roster and carries it inside the signed candidate
as `qualification/tester-roster.json`. The signed candidate checksum inventory and manifest source
commit bind those roster bytes without creating an impossible Git-hash self-reference. No roster
is synthesized by the repository; missing real assignments are an intentional go/no-go blocker.
Final acceptance requires each physical, Firefox Web Serial, Safari fallback, and native-installer
row to match its exact assignment. An unlisted identity, substituted board, or substituted host
cannot satisfy the matrix even when every scenario is marked passing.
